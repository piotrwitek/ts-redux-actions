First of all please check our spectrum community and we recommend to ask your question there for a quickest response and the indexing in search engines: https://spectrum.chat/typesafe-actions

Alternatively you could also check Stack Overflow for answers to your "how to" questions.

The only good reason to use issue tracker for questions would be for "special cases" that doesn't fit into bug reports and feature requests categories.
